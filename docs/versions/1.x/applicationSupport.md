# Application Support

The goal is for the library to handle cross-platform engine input support so that only one library is needed by developers to be able to handle input management. If you like the API then you should be able to re-use this as long as the engine supports C# level syntax. 

>[!TIP]
> ** Application Implementations **
>If a game engine or other application you want to use does not have an implementation available for use, and you benefit from this library, please consider adding one and sharing it. You can add a reference to it on the this page

## Supported Applications and related Roadmap

- **Godot v4**: plans are to release a version supported by a framework suite of software for C# as abstractions that will then have implementations within the engine
- **Unity3D**: A previous version of the library was given limited support, but it has not been maintained and there were a few bugs remaining in its implementation. Given the agnostic software suite and related initial Godot implementation being developed, there are no plans to continue with the maintanence of the Unity3D project at this time. If an update or new codebase is made to support it, it will be placed here.
